# Publishing zuraffa_storage

This package is published to pub.dev under the zuraffa.com publisher.

## No local development override

The `dependency_overrides:` block that used to point `zuraffa` at the local
core checkout (`../zuraffa`) has been removed for good — the published core
version resolves the dependency. Nothing to remove before publishing, and
nothing to restore afterwards.

## Steps

1. Bump `version:` in `pubspec.yaml`.
2. Add the release entry to `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. `dart pub get`
4. `dart format --set-exit-if-changed . && dart analyze && dart test`
5. `dart pub publish --dry-run` — must report no errors.
6. `dart pub publish`

**Mono version policy:** every package in the zuraffa fleet shares one version number. Bump the whole fleet with `../zuraffa/scripts/update_fleet.sh <version>`. Whenever a version is updated, the install guide in this repo's README.md MUST be updated to that release version in the same change — no old version constraints may linger in README install snippets. Dependency constraints on `zuraffa` itself must move to `^<version>` in the same bump.
